# HW 04 Timed Quiz

## Description

For this assighment we made a password generator using the various things we learned in class such as varibales, objects, functions, if statments, loops, etc.
There were many ways to write the same code but the way I wrote it made the most sense to me and kept it as simple as possible. I bumped into a strange problem that might be my my local machines issue. When I click ok on all the promps sometimes the clicks dont register as quick as im clicking.
