# HW 04 Timed Quiz

## Description

For this project we had to create a time based quiz that subtracts the time whenever a question was incorrect along with the user being able to store their highscore locally. This project was challenging because there were multiple ways to handle many situations. The hardest thing for myself was making the timer react to the incorrect answers.
This project helped me understand data types and how diffrent functions can give diffrent actions or results depending.
